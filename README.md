## Implementation Notes

# Mandatory: longest_word.py
  Accepts user input and finds the longest word(s)
  Handles punctuation, edge cases, and equal-length words
  Uses a helper function with string.punctuation for cleaning text
# Challenges 
  Being First time be introduced to some concepts but through researc managed to implement it.
  
# Optional 2: client_management_system.py
  Console-based CRUD system using list of dictionaries
  Allows adding, viewing, editing, deleting, and searching clients
# Comments
  This was atleast simple to implent as it most uses common syntax of inputs and choice functions.
  
# Optional 3: simple_algorithm.py
  Implements Bubble Sort step-by-step
  Shows comparisons, swaps, and timing
  Compares performance with Python's built-in sort
  Uses time module to measure efficiency
# Comments
  It wasn't easy to implement this algorithm and required much research to implement it.
